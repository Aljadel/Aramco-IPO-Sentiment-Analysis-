"#Aramco replaced #Alibaba to top the world IPO record with US$25.6 billion raised, or a total US$29.4 billion, including option exercised. It now has a mkt cap of US$1.7 Trillion and expected to be pumped closer to US$2 T after it starts trading tomorrow in Saudi's local market."
"The possible effects on KSA’s national budget of the Aramco's IPO have been ignored:
- one-off income transferred to the PIF, which is headed by Crown Prince MBS
- a permanent loss of dividend inflows for the state"
While this story calls the Aramco IPO a windfall (it was)...it still only raised a quarter of what MBS wanted. That's why his Vision is now blurry.
"The public sector wage bill has increased to 50 per cent of expenditure, while the budget deficit is expected to widen to $50bn next year — almost twice the proceeds of the Saudi Aramco IPO.

"Lots of Qs:
1-Don't 6m lockup period & 12m contractual lockup apply?
